# Sentiment Analysis Using R

## Abstract

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the growth, engagement, and sentiment trends in the fields of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science based on post activity and discussions on a popular platform. Using various visualization techniques, sentiment analysis models, and topic modeling approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the study uncovers the dynamics, interconnectedness, and sentiments associated with these fields. The findings reveal a significant increase in post activity, distinct words per post, and predominantly positive sentiment, indicating growing interest, understanding, and appreciation for the potential applications and implications of these technologies. Furthermore, the study highlights the synergistic relationship between data science, artificial intelligence, and deep learning, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary research for driving innovation and unlocking new potential applications. Despite some limitations, such as data source biases and potential inaccuracies in sentiment and topic modeling, the results provide valuable insights into the evolving landscape of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science, and their impact on various industries and the job market.

### Code

Coding was done on Quarto. Quarto made it simple to use compared to R Markdown. Although it took some time to transition from R Markdown, it was relatively straightforward.

### Data

The raw data set was obtained from Reddit API using scraping technique with Python Reddit API Wrapper package. However, due to their size, the datasets were not able to download onto github; hence, seperate links are provided for those who want to simulate the paper for themselves:
