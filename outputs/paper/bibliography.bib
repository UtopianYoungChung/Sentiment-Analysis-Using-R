  abstract = {The web contains a wealth of product reviews, but sifting through them is a daunting task. Ideally, an opinion       mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features,   etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin by identifying the unique properties of this     problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on     information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary     depending on the testing situation. The best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When           operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. But in the     context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are        qualitatively quite useful.},
